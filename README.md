### Lomeca: LOcal MEdia CAst

Lomeca (short for Local Media Cast) is an open-source software designed to effortlessly parse a directory of media files and display them on a webpage. It also allows users with access to the webpage to stream the content through a peer-to-peer (p2p) proxy, enabling seamless media sharing within a local network.

#### Features
- **Directory Parsing**: Automatically scans a designated directory for media files.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface to browse and select media files.
- **Streaming via P2P**: Enables users to stream selected media content through a peer-to-peer proxy.
- **Customizable Settings**: Easily configurable settings for directory paths, server ports, and more.
- **Open Source**: Released under the MIT License for full transparency and community collaboration.

#### Technologies Used
- **Golang**: Backend server for handling directory parsing and streaming functionality.
